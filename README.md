# **Credits**
This design was inspired by [this](https://youtu.be/zAVhHHS_IH4) tutorial and my [previouse resume](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEgUobQBDs/5g3Szmf1whSjIX_Zak9XMA/view?utm_content=DAEgUobQBDs&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton) made in Canva.
I **wrote this code by following the authors video step by step** and integrating my settings for each element. I had a lot of difficulties, but in the end I achieved the result that I expected.
